# German Credit Analysis

This project involves analyzing a dataset of German credit applications to predict the creditworthiness of applicants. The dataset contains a mix of numerical and categorical features, which are used to classify individuals into two categories: good credit and bad credit. The goal is to use machine learning techniques to predict whether an applicant will be granted credit based on their profile.

## **Project Overview**

The **German Credit Analysis** project focuses on building a model that can predict whether an applicant is likely to have "good" or "bad" credit. The dataset consists of multiple features such as age, sex, credit history, amount of credit, and more. We use classification techniques, such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**, to build and evaluate predictive models.

## **Key Features**

- **Data Exploration**: Explore the German credit dataset, which includes demographic and credit history information.
- **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale the data to prepare for model building.
- **Classification Models**: Build and compare machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest) to classify credit applicants.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate and compare the performance of different models.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model performance using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
- **Feature Importance**: Evaluate the impact of different features in predicting creditworthiness using various algorithms.
